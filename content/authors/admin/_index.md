I am a fourth year PhD student in Computer Science advised by Prof. Chris Fletcher.

Before joining CS@Illinois at UIUC, I worked at ARM. My work at ARM included research on Deep Learning accelerators, SoC design/verification and GPU verification. I received my bachelors from NIT-K Surathkal in 2015 from ECE department, where I was advised by Prof. Sumam David.

I am interested in building radically new system architectures containing multiple hardware accelerators to improve the performance/power efficiency of various workloads. I envision a future in computing where the supercomputers will be powered by domain specific massively heterogeneous architectures. Such processors can give unprecedented boost in both performance and power efficiency while helping us build the next generation exascale computers! If that resonates with your thoughts, feel free to drop me a line!

I have tried to pen down my  {{< staticref "media/CV_Kartik_Hegde.pdf" "newtab" >}}research statement{{< /staticref >}}.
